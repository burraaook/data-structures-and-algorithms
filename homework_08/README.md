# Compilation and Run  

- "make" command in src directory compiles the program.
- "make run" runs the program.  

# Description  

- Implementing Adjacency List Graph which can grow, and shrink dynamically. This Graph implementation uses Vertex class, and it has other features like filter, add, remove, exporting matrix version of graph etc..
- Making traversals which are different version of BFS, and DFS in DynamicGraph.
- Implement a Dijkstra Algorithm which uses boosting feature.
- Complexity Analyses, detailed explanations of implementations/algorithms, test cases/results are in the report.
