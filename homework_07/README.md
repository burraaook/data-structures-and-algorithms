# Compilation and Run  

- "make" command in src directory compiles the program.
- "make run" runs the program.  

# Description  

- An algorithm that takes a binary tree and an array of items as input, and it returns a binary search tree as output. The structure of the binary search tree should be same as the structure of the binary tree.
- An algorithm which converts the BST into an AVL tree by using rotation operations. Rotations are made from leaves to root.  
- Custom Skip List implementation which increases its level 10 by 10. If the number of items between two tallest neighbors of an item is 5, then the chance of adding this item to an upper-level list is 50%.
- Complexity Analyses, detailed explanations of implementations/algorithms, test cases/results are in the report.
