# Compilation and Run  

- "make" command in src directory compiles the program.
- "make run" runs the program.  

# Description  

4 different recursion algorithms which are explained/analyzed in detail in the Report.  

- Recursive algorithm to search a given string in another given bigger string
- Recursive algorithm to find the number of items in the array between two given integer values.(similar to binary search)
- Finding contiguous subarray(s) that the sum of its/theirs items is equal to a given integer value.
- Printing blocks with different configurations.
- Complexity Analyses, detailed explanations of implementations/algorithms, test cases/results are in the report.
