# Compilation and Run  

- "make" command in src directory compiles the program.
- "make run" runs the program.  

# Description  

Implementing Binary Heap, and Binary Search Tree differently than their original implementation.  

- Binary Heap implementation is made with using node-link structure.(originally it has array based implementation)
- Binary Search Tree implementation is made with using array structure.(originally it has node link based implementation)
- Complexity Analyses, detailed explanations of implementations/algorithms, test cases/results are in the report.
